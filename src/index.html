                To help make myself better suited to these roles, I plan to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Research systems architecture and deepen my understanding on how computers work at a hardware level.</li>
                    <li>Consider enrolling in courses such as CS50 to help strengthen my skills, understanding and also portfolio.</li>
                    <li>Work on personal projects such as developing simple kernels or contributing to open-source projects to help build a portfolio.</li>
                </ul>
